### TypeScript Overviews

So what is TypeScript? TypeScript is more like Javascript hence all variables syntax and functions apply to this as well. The only thing that weâ€™re really doing with TypeScript is adding a little bit of additional syntax to our code to handle something called a **The Type System**. This is what TypeScript is all about. And Typescript Code is a JavaScript with type annotations..
<br />
<br />**TypeScript = JavaScript + The Type System**

#### The TS Type System

The goal of the Type System are all follows.

- Helps us catch errors during development
- Uses 'type annotations' to analyze our code
- Only active during development
- Doesn't provide any performance optimization

## Environmental setup

Install the TypeScript compiler. It's an one time setup!

```bash
npm install -g typescript ts-node
```

Make sure that it is successfully installed by running

```bash
tsc --help
tsc --version
```

To run a TypeScript file

```bash
ts-node index.ts
```

### Type

A type is an easy way to refer to the different properties and functions that a value has. In JavaScript and TypeScript, a value can be anything that we can assign to a variable, such as strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, objects, functions, classes, arrays, and more. There are two major types:

#### Primitive Types

- Number, boolean, void, undefined, sting, symbol and null

#### Object Types

- functions, arrays, classes and objects

#### Why do we care about Types?

- Types are used by the TypeScript Compiler to analyze our code for errors.
- Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase.

#### Points

- **Introduction to TypeScript:** Consider providing a brief introductory statement about the importance of TypeScript and its growing popularity in the development community. Emphasize its role in building robust and scalable applications.

- **Real-world Examples:** Throughout the document, consider adding real-world examples or scenarios where TypeScript's type system helps catch errors and enhances code quality.

- **Benefits of TypeScript:** In the overview section, highlight the key benefits of using TypeScript, such as enhanced code
